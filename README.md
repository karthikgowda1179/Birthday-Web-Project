# Birthday Web Project
This project is a small interactive web experience dedicated to my partner's 20th birthday. Though simple in design, the webpage features playful interactions, including a "Yes!!" button that reveals a cute birthday cat gif and a surprise button that redirects to another page for an additional surprise.

# Features
- Interactive Button: A "No" button that playfully moves away when hovered over.
- Surprise Reveal: Clicking the "Yes!!" button hides the initial elements and reveals a cute birthday cat gif.
- Additional Surprise: A follow-up button appears after the initial surprise, inviting users to see another surprise by redirecting to a different webpage.
- Birthday Card: A dedicated page showcasing an animated birthday card and envelope, with a small message written inside the card.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: For styling the elements, including animations and transitions.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the buttons.

# How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open index.html in a web browser.
- Interact with the buttons to experience the playful elements and surprises.

# Project Structure
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- styles.css: The CSS file for styling the webpage.

# Known Bugs:
If the "No" button moves away from cursor too many times in a short period of time, the website can crash. Feedback in fixing this issue is heavily appreciated.
